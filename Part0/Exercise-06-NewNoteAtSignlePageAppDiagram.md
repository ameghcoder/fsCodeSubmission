3. **What is interesting in it**, I saw you JS code, a js snippet screentshot is below, In this image you see clearly your ***redrawNotes()*** function is called before the ***sendToServer(note)*** function, means you already add this in the note without check the response (I mean without check it, it may be 404, 500, 403). I think you ðŸ˜Ž confident on your code or server. Sorry, if you fill odd, I only want to tell you about this <span style="color: orange">**Code Warning**</span>
